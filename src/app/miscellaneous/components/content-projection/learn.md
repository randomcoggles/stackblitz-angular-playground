### Single-slot content projection
    Single-slot content projection refers to creating a component into which you can project one component.

### Multi-slot content projection
    Each slot can specify a CSS selector that determines which content goes into that slot.

### Conditional content projection
    If your component needs to conditionally render content, or render content multiple times, you should configure that component to accept an <ng-template>
